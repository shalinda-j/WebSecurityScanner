# AegisX - Advanced Web Security Testing Platform

A comprehensive security platform for identifying web application vulnerabilities, malware, and security weaknesses with actionable reporting.

## Overview

AegisX is an advanced security assessment platform designed to help security professionals identify and address vulnerabilities in web applications. Named after the shield of Zeus in Greek mythology, AegisX provides powerful protection through multiple specialized modules that form a complete security assessment solution.

## Key Features

### Core Scanning Capabilities
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Detect common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- **Configuration Analysis**: Identify server misconfigurations and security issues
- **Version Detection**: Discover outdated software with known vulnerabilities
- **Data Exposure**: Find sensitive data leakage and information disclosure

### Advanced Modules

#### Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Module
- **Quantum Resistance Assessment**: Evaluate cryptographic implementations for quantum computing threats
- **PQC Algorithm Comparison**: Compare classical vs. post-quantum cryptographic approaches
- **Educational Resources**: Learn about quantum-resistant cryptography
- **Implementation Recommendations**: Get actionable guidance for improving quantum resistance

#### Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Simulator
- **Attack Phase Simulation**: Emulate sophisticated APT techniques across all attack phases
- **Comprehensive Scenarios**: Choose from various APT scenarios (data exfiltration, ransomware, supply chain)
- **Kill Chain Analysis**: View findings organized by the APT kill chain
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Receive tactical and strategic defense guidance

#### Malware Traffic Analysis
- **Traffic Pattern Detection**: Identify suspicious traffic patterns and behavior
- **Static Resource Analysis**: Examine JavaScript and downloadable resources for malicious indicators
- **Communication Analysis**: Detect suspicious external connections and data exfiltration channels
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Observe behavior of suspicious code in controlled environments
- **Educational Resources**: Learn about malware detection techniques and defensive strategies

### Reporting and Analysis
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Detailed findings with severity ratings and remediation advice
- **Visual Analytics**: Charts and visualizations to understand vulnerability distribution
- **Evidence Collection**: Capture proof of vulnerabilities for verification
- **Remediation Guidance**: Clear, actionable recommendations for addressing findings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database
- Required packages (see installation instructions)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd aegisx
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up the database
```bash
# Configure DATABASE_URL environment variable
# Then run:
python -c "from app import db; db.create_all()"
```

4. Run the application
```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
```

## Usage

### Basic Scanning
1. Navigate to the AegisX dashboard
2. Click "New Scan"
3. Enter the target URL and select modules to run
4. View results in the Reports section

### Post-Quantum Cryptography Assessment
1. Navigate to the PQC dashboard
2. Explore educational resources or start a PQC-focused scan
3. Compare classical vs. post-quantum algorithms
4. Get implementation recommendations

### Advanced Persistent Threat Simulation
1. Navigate to the APT Simulator dashboard
2. Select a simulation scenario (comprehensive, data exfiltration, ransomware, or supply chain)
3. Configure simulation intensity and specific techniques
4. View results organized by the APT kill chain

### Malware Traffic Analysis
1. Navigate to the Malware Traffic Analysis dashboard
2. Select analysis mode (passive, active, or hybrid)
3. Choose scan depth based on thoroughness needed
4. Review findings across multiple analysis stages

## Architecture

AegisX is built with a modular architecture:
- **Core Engine**: Coordinates scanning and analysis modules
- **Scanner Modules**: Individual modules for various vulnerability types
- **Specialized Modules**: Advanced analysis capabilities (PQC, APT, Malware)
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based UI for configuration and results
- **Database**: Stores scan results, vulnerabilities, and reports

## Security Considerations

AegisX is designed for authorized security testing only. Always ensure you have proper permission before scanning any website or system.
